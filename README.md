# Park Pulse: Disney Wait Time Tracker

Park Pulse is a modern, real-time dashboard for tracking wait times at **Disneyland Park** and **Disney California Adventure**. Built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS, it offers a premium user experience for analyzing ride availability and trends.

## 🚀 Key Features

### ⭐️ Favorites System (**New**)
*   **Personalized List**: Star your favorite rides to keep them at the top of your view.
*   **Persistent**: Your favorites are saved automatically to your device, so they're there when you come back.

### 📊 Real-Time Dashboard
*   **Live Data**: Connects to the [ThemeParks.wiki API](https://themeparks.wiki) for up-to-the-minute wait times.
*   **Park Status**: Instant "Busyness" indicator (Quiet, Moderate, Busy, Very Busy) based on park-wide averages.
*   **Search**: Instantly filter rides by name.
*   **Skeleton Loading**: Polished shimmer effects while data fetch is in progress.

### 📱 Advanced List View
The table view is optimized for power users and mobile devices:
*   **Drag-and-Drop Columns**: Customize your view by dragging column headers. Reorder them however you like (e.g., move "Wait Time" next to "Ride Name").
    *   *Mobile Friendly*: Touch-optimized drag handles are always visible.
*   **Sticky Columns**: The first column in your custom order stays frozen while you scroll horizontally to view hourly forecasts.
*   **Smart Sorting**: Sort by **Favorites**, Ride Name, Wait Time, Status, Land, or **Ticket Tier**.
*   **Ticket Value**: Rides are categorized by tier for easy filtering:
    *   **E-Ticket**: Headliners (e.g., *Rise of the Resistance*, *Space Mountain*).
    *   **D-Ticket**: Major attractions.
    *   **C/B/A-Ticket**: Smaller experiences.
*   **Hourly Forecasts**: Color-coded columns (Green/Yellow/Red) show predicted wait times for 9AM, 11AM, 1PM, etc.
*   **Trend Sparklines**: Visual line charts showing the wait time trend for the day.

### 🖼️ Grid View
*   **Visual Cards**: Browse rides with a clean, card-based layout.
*   **History Charts**: Click any ride card to expand a detailed interactive chart of wait time history.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Refactoring
The application has been refactored for modularity and maintainability:
*   **Modular Components**: Broken down into `RideGrid`, `RideTable`, `HeaderToolbar`, and `StatsHeader` for better separation of concerns.
*   **Strict Typing**: Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for all data structures (`Ride`, `WaitTimeSnapshot`, etc.).
*   **Server Actions**: Secure server-side data fetching and file usage.

*   **Library**: React 19
